# VCFLabConstructor
VMware Lab Constructor (VLC) is a utility intended to automate the deployment of VMware
Cloud Foundation (VCF) in a nested environment. Although this is not a supported or
recommended method for deploying VCF, this allows individuals to learn about VCF with a
greatly reduced set of resource requirements.
In addition to deploying the nested infrastructure needed to support a VCF deployment,
VMware Lab Construcor can also automate the deployment of VCF and configure required
services, if desired.
